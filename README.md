Hi! I'm unsure if the PythonFiddle link will work so welcome to my GitHub! I'm very excited to be applying for this :)

This program has two functions.
First, the checkWin function will check input possibilities and compare the user input to the randomly generated play.
This function is then called in the main function.
The user will play against the computer for best 2 out of 3 draws.
